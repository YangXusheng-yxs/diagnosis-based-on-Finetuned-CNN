## Highlights
• A novel diagnosis method is first proposed from a perspective on gas turbine group

• A flexible architecture with deep transfer learning help reduce feature discrepancy

• A collection of experiment shows the superiorities of the proposed technique

• Detailed visualization first reveals how features transfer between gas turbines

## Requirements

The code runs correctly with

* Python==3.6
* Keras ==2.2.4
